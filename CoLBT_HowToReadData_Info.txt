*** There are two folders, corresponging to realistic CoLBT simulation(16000 events in it) and hydro background(400 events in it),respectively.
*** To improve the computational efficiency, we just use 400 background events to simulate 16000 CoLBT events. So for each CoLBT event_{A}, the corresponding
background event_{B} id B is A%400

1. For each event in CoLBT simulation, there are 7 files, including gamma.dat, parton.dat, hadjet.dat, tc_inf.dat, NewConRecom.dat, dNdEtaPtdPtdPhi_Charged.dat 
   and dNdEtaPtdPtdPhi_All.dat
   (1) gamma.dat includes the energy-momentum of direct photon, having 4 columns(px, py, pz, E)

   (2) parton.dat is the initial parton shower(including MPI partons) generated by PYTHIA8, 
       having 7 columns( eventid(not necessary), particle_id, px, py, pz, E, formation_time)

   (3) hadjet.dat is the jet reconstructed by final particles(anti-KT && Not all events have due to kinetic cuts)
       having 6 columns(jet_number, px, py, pz, E, eta)

   (4) tc_inf.dat is the final hard partons from LBT simulation, having 10 columns
       (particle id, px, py, pz, E, x, y, z, t, cat). cat is used to identify parton type(0==shower parton, 2==recoil parton, 4==radiated gluon)

   (5) NewConRecom.dat is the final hadrons from tc_inf.dat hadronization, having 10 columns
       (pid, px, py, pz, E, mass, x, y, z, t)

   (6) dNdEtaPtdPtdPhi_Charged.dat is soft charged hadrons distribution from hydro simulation and calculated by Cooper-frye formula. 
       It is a 3d distribution and we always reshape it to (NY, NPT, NPHI). For example, when we do analysis, we always do the following:
       "np.loadtxt( os.path.join(path, 'dNdEtaPtdPtdPhi_Charged.dat') ).reshape(NY, NPT, NPHI)/(HBARC**3.0)"
       NY, NPT, NPHI are rapidity, transverse momentum and azimuthal angle bins. In this data, they can be found in the const.py. The ranges of them 
       could also be found in const.py. By the way, const.py also shows how to integrate each of them.

       The dNdEtaPtdPtdPhi_Charged.dat includes the hydro background and hydro response induced by jet. Therefore, if you want to get pure hydro response,
       you should use dNdEtaPtdPtdPhi_Charged.dat in CoLBT simulation minus dNdEtaPtdPtdPhi_Charged.dat in corresponging background.(see ***)

   (7) dNdEtaPtdPtdPhi_All.dat is the same as dNdEtaPtdPtdPhi_Charged.dat, but includes contribution from neutral particles


~~~ I also put a code called "spec_new.py" which shows some calculation within dNdEtaPtdPtdPhi_Charged.dat(pt spectra, vn and so on)


By the way, due to data transfer limitations, I just put 8000 events(half of 16000) in this folder. The other half will be sent later.
